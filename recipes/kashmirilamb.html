      <h4>Steps</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Place red chiles, green chiles, cumin seeds, garam masala, ginger, garlic, grated coconut, and tomatoes into a blender; pulse several times to chop, then blend into a smooth paste.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Stir in onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, and continue cooking and stirring until the onion is very tender and golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes more.

        </li>
        <li>Stir the spice paste into the onion and cook and stir until the oil separates from the mixture, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in lamb pieces and salt. Cook, stirring frequently over medium-high heat, until the lamb pieces are browned on all sides, about 8 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Mix in yogurt, saffron, and blanched almonds until well combined.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, until the meat is tender and the gravy is thick, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Garnish the curry with chopped cilantro before serving.</li>
      </ol>
